# 🚨 Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–based Fraud Detection System to identify fraudulent financial transactions. The system uses advanced classification techniques and handles imbalanced data to achieve reliable fraud detection.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial fraud causes significant losses worldwide. This project aims to automatically classify transactions as **Fraudulent** or **Legitimate** using Machine Learning models.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Imbalanced data handling using **SMOTE**
- Fraud classification using **Random Forest**
- Performance evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Interactive **Streamlit web application**
